## Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system."


DRY is about the duplication of knowledge, of intent. Itâ€™s about expressing the same thing in two different places, possibly in two totally different ways. <br>

It is a software development principle aiming to reduce code duplication which can lead to a poor refactoring and a poor maintenance.

The idea is to reduce the amount of redundant work that developers need to do, which can save time and effort, reduce the risk of errors and inconsistencies, and make the codebase easier to understand and maintain.

To follow the DRY principle, developers should strive to create modular, reusable components that can be easily shared and reused across different parts of the codebase. This can be achieved through the use of functions, libraries, modules, and other abstractions that encapsulate specific functionality.
