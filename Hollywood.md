# The Hollywood principle

The Hollywood Principle is a software design principle that states “don’t call us, we’ll call you.” In other words, 
it encourages loose coupling between modules by having high-level modules depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations. 
This makes it easier to swap out implementations without affecting the rest of the system.
